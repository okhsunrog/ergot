//! defmt global_logger implementation for ergot
//!
//! This module provides a defmt Logger that sends raw defmt frames over the
//! ergot network. Similar to the `log_v0_4` module's approach, this prevents
//! infinite loops by using a GEID (Get Ergot Internal Defmt-logger) system.
//!
//! ## Feature Flags
//!
//! This module is only available with the **`defmt-sink`** feature flag.
//!
//! - **`defmt-v1`**: Enables defmt::Format on ergot types + defmt message types
//! - **`defmt-sink`**: Enables THIS module (DefmtSink implementation)
//!
//! ## Use Cases
//!
//! **Scenario 1: Use your own defmt logger (e.g., defmt-rtt)**
//! ```toml
//! ergot = { version = "0.12", features = ["defmt-v1"] }  # NOT defmt-sink
//! defmt-rtt = "0.4"
//! ```
//! Result: ergot's types have defmt::Format, ergot's internal logs go to defmt-rtt
//!
//! **Scenario 2: Use ergot as a network-based defmt logger**
//! ```toml
//! ergot = { version = "0.12", features = ["defmt-sink"] }
//! ```
//! Result: All defmt logs (including ergot's) are sent over the ergot network
//!
//! **Scenario 3: Receive defmt logs from network on host**
//! ```toml
//! ergot = { version = "0.12", features = ["defmt-v1", "tokio-std"] }
//! ```
//! Result: Can subscribe to ErgotDefmtRxTopic and decode incoming defmt frames
//!
//! ## Architecture Overview
//!
//! * Which defmt sink does ERGOT use for logging? Valid choices are:
//!   * A user provided logger (e.g., defmt-rtt, defmt-itm)
//!   * A null logger (compiler removes defmt calls)
//! * Should ergot serve as the global defmt logger?
//!
//! For Ergot's defmt logger:
//!
//! * If !ERGOT_GLOBAL_SET && !ERGOT_SPECIFIC_SET: defmt is not used internally
//! * If ERGOT_GLOBAL_SET && !ERGOT_SPECIFIC_SET: defmt calls are compiled out
//! * If ERGOT_SPECIFIC_SET: use user's defmt logger, hope it isn't ergot
//!
//! ## Complete Usage Example
//!
//! ### On the Embedded Device (Sender)
//!
//! ```ignore
//! use ergot::{
//!     logging::defmt_v1::DefmtSink,
//!     logging::defmtlog::ErgotDefmtTx,
//!     well_known::ErgotDefmtTxTopic,
//!     NetStack,
//! };
//!
//! // Your ergot network stack
//! static STACK: NetStack<...> = ...;
//!
//! // Define the global logger
//! #[defmt::global_logger]
//! struct GlobalLogger;
//!
//! unsafe impl defmt::Logger for GlobalLogger {
//!     fn acquire() {
//!         DefmtSink::acquire()
//!     }
//!     unsafe fn flush() {
//!         DefmtSink::flush()
//!     }
//!     unsafe fn release() {
//!         DefmtSink::release()
//!     }
//!     unsafe fn write(bytes: &[u8]) {
//!         DefmtSink::write(bytes)
//!     }
//! }
//!
//! // In your main function, initialize the sink with a send function
//! #[embassy_executor::main]
//! async fn main() {
//!     // Initialize the defmt sink
//!     DefmtSink::init_with_sender(|frame| {
//!         _ = STACK.topics().broadcast_borrowed::<ErgotDefmtTxTopic>(
//!             &ErgotDefmtTx { frame },
//!             None,
//!         );
//!     });
//!
//!     // Now you can use defmt logging!
//!     defmt::info!("System initialized, temp={}", temperature);
//!     defmt::warn!("Low battery: {}%", battery_level);
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! ### On the Host/Controller (Receiver)
//!
//! ```ignore
//! use ergot::{
//!     logging::defmtlog::ErgotDefmtRx,
//!     well_known::ErgotDefmtRxTopic,
//! };
//!
//! // Subscribe to defmt frames
//! let mut rx = stack.subscribe::<ErgotDefmtRxTopic>(None)?;
//!
//! // Receive and decode frames
//! while let Ok(frame_msg) = rx.recv().await {
//!     let frame = frame_msg.frame;
//!
//!     // Decode using defmt-decoder + ELF file
//!     // (defmt-decoder crate provides the decoder implementation)
//!     match decoder.decode(frame) {
//!         Ok(decoded) => println!("{}", decoded),
//!         Err(e) => eprintln!("Failed to decode frame: {}", e),
//!     }
//! }
//! ```
