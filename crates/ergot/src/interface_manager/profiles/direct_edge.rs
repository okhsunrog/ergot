//! "Edge" device profile
//!
//! Edge devices are the second simplest device profile, and are intended for devices
//! that are on the "edge" of a network, e.g. they have a single upstream connection
//! to a bridge or seed router.
//!
//! These devices use as many tricks as possible to be as simple as possible. They
//! initially start not knowing their network ID, and if a packet is sent to them,
//! they assume the destination net ID is their net ID. They will also blindly send
//! any outgoing packets, rather than trying to determine whether that packet is
//! actually routable to a node on the network.
